# weather-forecasting-using-python-via-openweather-api
Abstract:
You will learn how to create a Python application in this project that uses the OpenWeatherMap API to gather meteorological data for any location on Earth, including the current temperature, pressure, humidity, wind speed, and many other variables. This task will be fairly quick and straightforward. To fully comprehend everything, you must dedicate 30 minutes.
By simply typing the city name, you can access these weather reports in real time. You will only be able to access data for locations that the OpenWeatherMap website lists (or supports).
